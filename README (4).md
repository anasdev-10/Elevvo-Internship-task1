# 🎓 Student Score Prediction

A machine learning project that predicts **student performance** based on given features.  
This notebook walks through **data exploration, preprocessing, visualization, model building, and evaluation** to build a reliable prediction pipeline.

---

## 📌 Project Overview
- Perform **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** to understand the dataset  
- Visualize relationships between variables using **Matplotlib** & **Seaborn**  
- Apply **data preprocessing** (scaling, encoding, splitting)  
- Build ML models with **Scikit-Learn**  
- Evaluate models using performance metrics  

---

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- **Python**  
- **NumPy** – numerical computations  
- **Pandas** – data handling  
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn** – data visualization  
- **Scikit-Learn** – preprocessing, pipelines, and ML models  

---

## 📊 Workflow
1. **Data Loading & Cleaning**  
   - Inspect dataset shape, missing values, and column types  

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**  
   - Statistical summary  
   - Distribution plots & correlations  

3. **Data Preprocessing**  
   - Feature scaling  
   - Encoding categorical variables  
   - Train-test splitting  

4. **Model Training**  
   - Linear Regression  
   - Pipelines for preprocessing + modeling  

5. **Model Evaluation**  
   - R² Score  
   - Mean Absolute Error (MAE)  
   - Mean Squared Error (MSE)
