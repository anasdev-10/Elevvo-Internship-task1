**🎓 Student Score Prediction**

A machine learning project that predicts student performance based on given features. The notebook walks through data exploration, preprocessing, visualization, model building, and evaluation to build a reliable prediction pipeline.

**📌 Project Overview**

Perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to understand the dataset.

Visualize relationships between variables using Matplotlib and Seaborn.

Apply data preprocessing (scaling, encoding, splitting).

Build machine learning models with Scikit-Learn.

Evaluate models using performance metrics.

**🛠️ Technologies Used**

Python

NumPy – numerical computations

Pandas – data handling

Matplotlib & Seaborn – data visualization

Scikit-Learn – preprocessing, pipelines, and ML models

**📊 Workflow**

Data Loading & Cleaning

Inspect dataset shape, missing values, and column types.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Statistical summary

Distribution plots & correlations

Data Preprocessing

Feature scaling

Encoding categorical variables

Train-test splitting

Model Training
